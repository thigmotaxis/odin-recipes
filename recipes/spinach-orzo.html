  <h3>Description</h3>
  Nobody likes these so I won't waste your time. It's pasta and cheese. You like those things. Just make and eat it.
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>8 oz baby spinach leaves, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup orzo</li>
    <li>3/4 cup crumbled feta, plus more if you are a good person who likes feta</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
    <li>2 tbs unsalted butter</li>
    <li>4 large scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp finely grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>parsely or cilantro, chopped for garnish</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium, then melt butter (30 seconds to 1 minute). Stir in approx. 3/4 of the scallions and all of the garlic
    and cook until softened (approx. 3 minutes), while stirring frequently</li>
    <li>Stir in spinach, adding in batches if needed, and 1/2 tsp salt. Continue to cook approx. 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until spinach is wilted</li>
    <li>Stir in stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in orzo, lemon zest, and the remaining 1/2 tsp of salt. Cover and simmer over medium heat 10-14 minutes
      until orzo is nearly cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Stir in cheese and parsley or cilantro, cover the pan, and cook for another 1 minute. To serve, sprinkle with additional cheese and the remaining scallions</li>
