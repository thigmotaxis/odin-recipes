  <h3>Description</h3>
  There is some pork. You put it in a pot. Then you take it out of the pot and put it inside yourself.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>One 4-5 lbs boneless pork shoulder, cut into 4 pieces</li>
    <li>12-15 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 grapefruit (approx 2/3 cups)</li>
    <li>3 tbs EVOO</li>
    <li>2 tbs light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbs fresh oregano leaves (or 1/2 tbs dried)</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbs kosher salt plus more if you feel like it</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>Cilantro, chopped for serving</li>
    <li>Lime wedges, for serving</li>
    <li>Hot sauce, for serving</li>
    <li>Tortillas if you feel you need the crutch of a wrapper</li>
    <li>Salsa (pico de gallo, verde, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a blender or small food processor, combine the garlic, grapefruit juice, lime zest and juice, 2 tbs EVOO, brown sugar, oregano, cumin, and salt</li>
    <li>Process until blended, then transfer to a large bowl and add the pork and bay leaf</li>
    <li>Toss to combine, then allow to marinate, covered, for at least one hour</li>
    <li>Take a break! Read a book! Say "hi" to your wife! Tell your cat it is special (even though it isn't)</li>
    <li>Heat the rest of the EVOO using the pressure cooker's saute function on medium</li>
    <li>Remove the pork from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Cook the pork in batches until it is browned on all sides (approx. 12 minutes total), deglazing
    as needed</li>
    <li>When all pork is browned, return it to the pot along with the reserved marinade and bay leaf</li>
    <li>Cover and cook on high pressure for 80 minutes and let the pressure release naturally</li>
    <li>Take another break! Apologize to your cat for inflating its ego and consequently leaving it unprepared for the sharp edges of adulthood</li>
    <li>Remove the pork and the bay leaf, then reduce the jus by boiling it for 10-15 minutes using the saute function</li>
    <li>Shred the pork, then toss with the jus</li>
    <li>Eat it in the manner which brings you the most joy</li>
  </ol>
